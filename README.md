# Project Title

This is a Number Guessing Game that will give the user 3 attempts to guess a random number generated between 1-10. The game will give the user a hint after the first 2 incorrect guesses and let the user know of their failure on 3 incorrect guesses and start a new round. If at any point the user guesses the number correctly the game will alert the user and start a new round.
